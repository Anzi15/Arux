## About The Project

There are many great E-commerce websites available on GitHub, however, I wanted a one for my clients that really suit thier needs so I created this ultimate one. I want to create a E-commerce website so amazing that it'll be the last one my client ever need.

Here's why:

- Client's time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- Client shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating adding and removing products from coding

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
